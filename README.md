# Tone Generator

A tone generator written in Rust and controllable via MIDI.

This project is a learning experiment based heavily on the examples
of the [rust-jack crate](https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-jack).

The goals:
- Write a Rust program
- Make an audio signal and modify it based on MIDI input.
